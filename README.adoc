Bingo Game

Used in training classes to help students get accustomed to
object-oriented concepts.

To play, execute `gradlew run` or double-click on jar file found
in the directory `build/libs/BingoApp.jar` after a full build.
Click on each term when you hear it during class. That
will both change the background color of the button and disable it,
while checking for bingo.

Bingo is when you get all in a row horizontally,
vertically, or diagonally. To play again, use the `Restart` menu
item or the `Alt-R` keyboard shortcut.

Note `Alt-M` mutes the "tada" sound played when you get bingo. That
is a toggle, so you can mute or unmute the sound as desired.
